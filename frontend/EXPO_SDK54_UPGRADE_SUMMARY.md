## Manual Steps

1. If Expo Go on your device is incompatible with SDK 54, you may need to build a development client:
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --clean && eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

## Rollback Instructions

To rollback to the previous state:
```bash
git checkout main
```

## Verification

- ✅ `npx expo start --clear` runs successfully without worklets errors
- ✅ No React Native version mismatch errors
- ✅ Metro bundler bundles successfully
- ✅ App opens on Expo Go (iOS) without red screen errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
